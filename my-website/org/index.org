* Overview
(site last updated: {{{modification-time(%Y %B %d)}}})

I am an atmospheric scientist interested in tropical overturning circulations
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon][monsoons]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell][Hadley cells]], and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone][Intertropical Convergence Zone]]) --- why they
exist, how they ebb and flow over the course of each year, how they may have
changed in Earth's history, how they may change in Earth's future, and even how
they behave in other planetary atmospheres.  Please see my [[file:research.org][Research]] page for
more.

I work at Columbia University, specifically the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory, where I am funded by an Earth Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship and
advised by [[http://www.columbia.edu/~ahs129/home.html][Dr. Adam Sobel]] and [[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~biasutti/][Dr. Michela Biasutti]].  We are working on a project
seeking to improve forecasting of the Indian monsoon summer rainfall on seasonal
to interannual timescales.

I am also co-leader of the "[[https://diynamics.github.io/][DIYnamics]]" project that seeks to improve the
teaching of meteorology, climate science, and other planetary-scale sciences at
the K-12 through graduate school levels by developing inexpensive, easy-to-use
kits for performing physical demonstrations of core scientific concepts.  Please
see the [[file:outreach.org][DIYnamics]] page or the [[https://diynamics.github.io/][official DIYnamics website]] for more.

I am also interested in the [[http://www.openscience.org/blog/][Open Science]] and [[http://opensource.org/][Open Source Software]] movements,
which manifests through developing open-source software tools for scientists in
the Python programming language.  Please see the [[file:aospy.org]["aospy"]], [[file:programming.org][Programming]], and
[[file:resources.org][Resources]] pages for more.

Please contact me (information below) with any questions about my research or
anything else you find on this site.  Thanks!
