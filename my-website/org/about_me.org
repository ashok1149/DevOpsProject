{{{PAGETITLE(About Me)}}}

I live in New York City with my wife, Alyssa, and our dog, Dempsey.  When not
doing science, I love exploring the city and surrounding area with Alyssa and
Dempsey: off-leash hours in Central Park (Dempsey's favorite), trying new
restaurants and coffee shops, running, seeing movies, and just relaxing at home
together.  I'm also an avid music fan/critic and book reader and an aspiring
gardener.
